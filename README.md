## App Brainstorming 
Favorite Applications: Instagram, Discord, Nike
1) Instagram:
* Ability to tag people on shared posts 
* Large group chats
* Commenting on shared posts
2) Discord:
* Creating channels to allow information to be much more readily accessible
* Allowing a single server to contain a large number of members
* Ability to implement an AI chatbot to provide assistance to members
3) Nike:
* Personalized customer experience
* Ability to easily connect and chat with Nike experts

Currently, I'm interested in creating a fitness app that provides a personalized user experience. Depending on the user's fitness goal and information, the app will provide the user with workout and nutritional plans. Users will be allowed to chat with professionals, connect with people that share similar fitness goals, and provide constructive feedback regarding the current state of the app or issues encountered whilst using the app. Ultimately, the goal of the app is to ensure that users can achieve their fitness goals, whether it be gaining muscle mass or losing weight, in the most efficient and safest way possible. 

## Notes
My initial challenge was understanding Swift syntax. However, after spending ample time reading Apple's Swift guide and familiarizing myself more with Swift, I overcame this issue.
